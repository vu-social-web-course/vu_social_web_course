    "\n",
    "Your goal in this task is to take the latitude and longitude coordinates you scraped in Exercise 1 and plot that location on a map. You will do this by first creating a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 1.1 Convert the output of Exercise 1 into KML\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first step is to create a `.kml` file. This is just a plain text file, structured using XML (similar to HTML), that stores geographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this step, you will need to:\n",
    "1.  Run your Python script from Exercise 1 to get the `latitude` and `longitude` values.\n",
    "2.  Create a new, empty text file and save it as `amsterdam.kml`.\n",
    "3.  Look at the documentation below to figure out the basic KML structure. You will need to create a \"Placemark\" for your location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* The most important tags you'll need to research are `<Placemark>`, `<Point>`, and `<coordinates>`.\n",
    "* KML requires coordinates in the format `longitude,latitude,altitude`. Your Python script outputs `latitude` *first*. Keep that in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation:**\n",
    "* **Official KML Documentation:** https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/?csw=1\n",
    "* **Simple KML Example:** https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/tools/Google-Earth/kml/index\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Task 1.2 Visualize the point on a Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your `amsterdam.kml` file, you need to visualize it. There are two ways to do this: a simple way to check your work, and a more advanced way that uses JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: The Simple Way (Used for Checking)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest way to see if your KML file works is to use a free online viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to a site like **https://kmzview.com/**.\n",
    "- Load `amsterdam.kml` file.\n",
    "- The map should fly to Amsterdam and show the placemark you defined. If it does, your KML file is correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: The Right Way (Using the Google Maps API)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method involves building a custom HTML page that loads the Google Maps API and adds your KML file as a layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a multi-step process. You will have to figure out how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Host Your KML File:** Your KML file must be available on a public URL. You can use a service like **http://pastebin.com/** for this. After you paste your KML code, be sure to find and copy the **\"RAW\" format URL**.\n",
    "2.  **Get an API Key:** You cannot use the Google Maps API without an API key. You can get one from the **[Google Cloud Console](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)**.\n",
    "3.  **Write the Code:** Create an `index.html` file. You will need to write JavaScript that:\n",
    "    * Loads the Google Maps JavaScript API (using your new API key).\n",
    "    * Initializes a new map.\n",
    "    * Creates a `google.maps.KmlLayer` object, passing in the **\"RAW\" URL** of your pastebin file.\n",
    "    * Adds that KML layer to your map.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hint:** The official Google Maps documentation for adding a **[KML Layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/kml)** will be your most important resource for this step."
